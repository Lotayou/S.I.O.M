S.I.O.M (Shitty Ideas Of Mine) is a constant reminder of these stupid mistakes I've made during research. Some of this are memorable, others are just hilarious. But anyway, each mistake I made and each lesson I learned helps me become a more mature researcher and better human being. I hereby dedicate this memoir to all PhDs, including you, and sincerely hope that you don't have to make these mistakes all over again.
